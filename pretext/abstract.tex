In this paper, we built a knowledge-based Q \& A system for small wiki farms, aiming at enhancing the searching capabilities of their search engines and make full use of the information on their servers.\\
As its name SEEKER, we will go deep into the semi-structured data and discover the relationship between articles and categories. We will realize natural language processing, graph discovering and data visualization tasks. The project is written in Python 3.\\
Here's the link of \href{https://youtu.be/oog_x8N7mC4}{a two-minute demo video} on Youtube, which can help you better understand of our project. The \href{https://github.com/programeggsoup/SilmPy/tree/master/SilmPy}{project code} is available on Github.
