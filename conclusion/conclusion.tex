In this paper, we develop a Q \& A system for a small wiki farm which supports both keyword searching and natural language querying. Users can interact with the dynamic graph and more detailed semi-structured explanation on its side. SEEKER is more powerful than the original search engine.\\
\indent Then, we want to move a bit forward from NLP2SQL method. For now, we only use the attributes of each article for natural language processing and doesn't make full use of the knowledge graph. What's more, there are restrictions of using SQL queries to answer more complicated questions. In the next step, we want to teach SEEKER understanding the plain text from the content of each article and expand our knowledge graph. Then, using subgraph isomorphism over the graph to answer the more detailed natural language questions from the users \cite{hu2018answering}.
